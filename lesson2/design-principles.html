                Repetition is achieved by repeating an element more than once throughout a design. While this may seem simple, 
				designers depend on the principle of repetition to create a feeling of organized movement and consistency within 
				a composition. In any design, you’ll find yourself having to repeat elements, but by doing so, you'll be able 
				to strengthen and unify the visual appeal of a design.
				The principle of repetition can also be an important business tactic. The visual elements of a company’s brand 
				identity act as the face for how a company is perceived. Utilizing repetition is not only useful within a singular 
				print, but can also be effective when it is displayed throughout a company’s design portfolio. A strong logo that 
				is repeated throughout social media, business cards, brochures, web design, etc., enhances a consumer’s experience 
				and makes a brand recognizable.
				Besides the actual method of repetition, designers typically incorporate repetition through wither, rhythm and patterns. 
				Patterns –the repetition of more than one design element working in unison with each other – are typically seen within 
				physical forms of design such as interior design or architecture, but is also popular for the background of web and app 
				pages. Rhythm refers to space in between elements that are repeated. Designers use the intervals between elements 
				strategically to create a sense of movement for viewers.

                Alignment helps us to create a sense of unity by providing structure and connecting elements in a subtle, 
				yet powerful way.
				
				Vertical and Horizontal Alignment
				It’s easy to confuse horizontal alignment and vertical alignment because they are both defined the opposite 
				way you might think. 
				
				Vertical Alignment
				When the center, top, and/or bottom of elements align on an invisible horizontal line, you create vertical alignment.
				Vertical alignment gets it name, not because of the invisible horizontal lines, but because of the vertical space 
				within the element being aligned with another. One trick to remember this is to think of the direction you go when 
				drawing a line from top to bottom.
				It’s not always necessary or possible for a row of elements to be vertically aligned by their tops, bottoms AND center. 
				In many cases, your elements will have variable heights and you’ll have to decide which of these makes the most sense.
				Top or Bottom Vertical Alignment
				When the heights of two or more elements are drastically different, it might make sense to vertically align them by 
				their tops or bottoms.

			<h2>PARC: Contrast</h2>

            <p>
				As you type, the contrast ratio indicated will update. Hover over the circle to get more detailed information. 
				When semi-transparent colors are involved as backgrounds, the contrast ratio will have an error margin, to account 
				for the different colors they may be over.
		    		Contrast is the tool that makes a design “pop,” making it memorable for viewers.
		    		Contrast also aids in the usability of a composition. A design’s organization is dependent upon 
		    		how contrast is used to lead a viewer’s eye towards what is most important. For instance, if all the 
		    		content within a design was the same size, how would your audience know what information is the most 
		    		significant? Through contrast designers are able to highlight certain elements they want to emphasize, 
		    		creating a focal point for an audience and a visual hierarchy.
